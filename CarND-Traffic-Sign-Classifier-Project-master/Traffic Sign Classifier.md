# **Traffic Sign Recognition** 

## Writeup
## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier

In this notebook, a template is provided for you to implement your functionality in stages which is required to successfully complete this project. If additional code is required that cannot be included in the notebook, be sure that the Python code is successfully imported and included in your submission, if necessary. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate where you should begin your implementation for your project. Note that some sections of implementation are optional, and will be marked with **'Optional'** in the header.

## Step 0: Load The Data


```python
# Load pickled data
import pickle

# TODO: Fill this in based on where you saved the training and testing data

training_file = "./traffic-signs-data/train.p"
testing_file = "./traffic-signs-data/test.p"

with open(training_file, mode='rb') as f:
    train = pickle.load(f)
with open(testing_file, mode='rb') as f:
    test = pickle.load(f)
    
X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']

print("X_train shape:", X_train.shape)
print("y_train shape:", y_train.shape)
print("X_test shape:", X_test.shape)
print("y_test shape:", y_test.shape)
```

    X_train shape: (39209, 32, 32, 3)
    y_train shape: (39209,)
    X_test shape: (12630, 32, 32, 3)
    y_test shape: (12630,)

## Step 1: Dataset Summary & Exploration

The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:

- `'features'` is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
- `'labels'` is a 2D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file `signnames.csv` contains id -> name mappings for each id.
- `'sizes'` is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the the original width and height the image.
- `'coords'` is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**

Complete the basic data summary below.


```python
### Replace each question mark with the appropriate value.
import numpy as np

# TODO: Number of training examples
n_train = len(X_train)

# TODO: Number of testing examples.
n_test = len(X_test)

# TODO: What's the shape of an traffic sign image?
image_shape = X_train[0].shape

# TODO: How many unique classes/labels there are in the dataset.
n_classes = len(np.unique(y_train))

print("Number of training examples =", n_train)
print("Number of testing examples =", n_test)
print("Image data shape =", image_shape)
print("Number of classes =", n_classes)
```

    Number of training examples = 39209
    Number of testing examples = 12630
    Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
    Number of classes = 43
    
Visualize the German Traffic Signs Dataset using the pickled file(s). This is open ended, suggestions include: plotting traffic sign images, plotting the count of each sign, etc.

The [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) [examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/index.html) and [gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html) pages are a great resource for doing visualizations in Python.

**NOTE:** It's recommended you start with something simple first. If you wish to do more, come back to it after you've completed the rest of the sections.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
# Visualizations will be shown in the notebook.
%matplotlib inline

# show image of 10 random data points
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2,5, figsize=(15, 6))
fig.subplots_adjust(hspace = .2, wspace=.001)
axs = axs.ravel()
for i in range(10):
    index = random.randint(0, len(X_train))
    image = X_train[index]
    axs[i].axis('off')
    axs[i].imshow(image)
    axs[i].set_title(y_train[index])

# histogram of label frequency
hist, bins = np.histogram(y_train, bins=n_classes)
width = 0.7 * (bins[1] - bins[0])
center = (bins[:-1] + bins[1:]) / 2
plt.bar(center, hist, align='center', width=width)
plt.show()
```
## Step 2: Design and Test a Model Architecture
Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test your model on the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

The LeNet-5 implementation shown in the classroom at the end of the CNN lesson is a solid starting point. You'll have to change the number of classes and possibly the preprocessing, but aside from that it's plug and play!

With the LeNet-5 solution from the lecture, you should expect a validation set accuracy of about 0.89. To meet specifications, the validation set accuracy will need to be at least 0.93. It is possible to get an even higher accuracy, but 0.93 is the minimum for a successful project submission.

There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:

Neural network architecture (is the network over or underfitting?)
Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
Generate fake data.
Here is an example of a published baseline model on this problem. It's not required to be familiar with the approach used in the paper but, it's good practice to try to read papers like these.

Pre-process the Data Set (normalization, grayscale, etc.)
Minimally, the image data should be normalized so that the data has mean zero and equal variance. For image data, (pixel - 128)/ 128 is a quick way to approximately normalize the data and can be used in this project.

Other pre-processing steps are optional. You can try different techniques to see if it improves performance.

Use the code cell (or multiple code cells, if necessary) to implement the first step of your project.
